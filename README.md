## Instructions from Code Challenge 1

First, Fork and Clone this repo to your computer.

There is a gif below that shows what these instructions ask you to build.

Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge:

1. Create a `<button>` element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate". 

2. Using jQuery, append a `<div>` element when you click the button. It should append a new div each time you click the button.

3. Inside the `<div>` element you created in the previous step, create a `<p>` element that shows how many times you have clicked the "Generate" button from the first step. It should reflect the count for that step - the first div you made should be 1, the second 2, etc.

4. Inside the `<div>` element created in step two, append two `<button>` elements with text of "Yellow" & "Delete". 

5. In a CSS file, any `<div>` created using the "Generate" button should start with red as it's `background-color`.

6. Clicking a "Yellow" `<button>` should change its parent `background-color` from red to yellow.

7. Clicking a "Delete" `<button>` should remove its parent `<div>` and that `<div>s` children (including the clicked on "Delete" button). 

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application.
